Wesnoth almost was never founded though, due to a foolish lich named Jevyan. Although he was feared by most, Jevyan was nothing more than a mopped up fool who fought with the wrong weapons. After the liches' defeat, Wesnoth grew and over the generations, it became stronger. However, over the years, many other foolish necromancers thought they were powerful enough to take on the human kingdom. Iliah-Malal, Mal-Ravanal, and Mal-Keshar. Fools! All of them, even though they reached fabulous goals such as creating a portal to the land of the dead, tearing the entire kingdom apart piece by piece, and destroying an organization called the Northern Alliance, these three undead masters were nothing but small contributions to my mother's plan of finalization."

A mage named Delfador, a general named Gweddry, and an Elf named... Pah! Dare I even say her name? Never! Anyway, these three heroes are the ones who stopped Wesnoth from falling, but also brought it one step closer to extinction. Take Delfador for instance, he was a mighty wizard often called ''The Great'' and he open the eyes of Wesnothian magi to many more powerful discoveries. Sounds like a good thing, but it's not. It was evil, which is why I love it. The same goes for all those heroes - they brought Wesnoth one step closer to greater prosperity. But humans are such foolish creatures. To think of whoever was sick enough to invent such a species as disgusting as they makes me want to vomit! Indeed, there is only one thing I like about this race, and that is that they are always their own undoing."
